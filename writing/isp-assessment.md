ISP Assessment Methodology
==========================

Background
----------

India engages in web censorship by ordering Internet Service Providers (ISPs) operating in its jurisdiction to block access to certain websites for users. As such, the private sector in India can play a role in ensuring that the impact of state surveillance and censorship is minimised, and that any such actions are transparent to users. ISPs can do so by publishing transparency reports that help users and researchers understand the scale of content takedown and information requests that they receive. Prior multi-stakeholder efforts like the Global Network Initiative (GNI) have already developed principles and best practices that can help companies respect users’ freedom of expression and privacy when faced with government pressure to hand over user data or  remove content. 

Furthermore, Indian regulations do not define the technical method of blocking, leaving it up to the ISPs to decide. Research has found that the four large ISPs in India (Reliance Jio, Airtel, BSNL and Atria Convergence Technologies) have made active decisions to [deploy methods of blocking](https://www.petsymposium.org/foci/2023/foci-2023-0006.php) that are incapable of sending censorship notices to users.

We have prepared a questionnaire to engage with ISPs in India on their policies and practices regarding state-ordered website-blocking, particularly to assess their compliance with net neutrality regulations and GNI principles and standards. We developed the questionnaire by using modified [GNI testing methodologies](https://globalnetworkinitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/AT2021.pdf), the [Manila Principles](https://manilaprinciples.org/index.html), and the [UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf). Specifically, we question ISPs on the legal processes they follow to implement censorship, what monitoring and notification mechanisms they utilise while blocking websites, how they approach technical decisions on website blocking and what accountability measures they have put in place.  

During our engagement with Internet service providers in India, we will also encourage them to (1) only act on narrowly tailored and specific censorship orders; (2) block content only on legal orders, and comply with net neutrality regulations; and (3) use technical methods that make the censorship transparent to users. 

The intended audience for our questionnaire is people who hold decision-making positions at ISPs with regards to receiving and implementing website blocking orders. While this questionnaire was framed with the Indian context in mind, it may be of use to researchers and civil society organisations in any country wherein ISPs are involved in implementing state-directed censorship.

Questionnaire
-------------

**Legal process**

* What state authorities have you received orders from? 
* Are there ever extra-legal requests for blocking that you receive?
* What is the process you follow after you receive a blocking order?
* Do you object to instances of blocking that you find illegal/unconstitutional? Is there such a company policy or even scope to do that?

**Monitoring**

* Is there an enforcement mechanism to see whether you’re blocking in accordance with orders? Or allowing access to what is not blocked?
* Does the Government or Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology contact you to increase the strictness of blocking? (complaining that something is blocked or unblocked?)
* Is there any notification when targets are unblocked? Do you have any policy regarding unblocking targets once they are declared unblocked by law?
* Is there any software tool or data analytics tool you use to determine whether blocking is working as intended for your customers?
* Are you legally or informally required (by the government or by company policy ) to implement a monitoring mechanism that evaluates whether users could evade censorship?

**Technical decisions**

* How do you decide what censorship methods to use?
* Is there company policy that censorship has to be transparent to the users?
* Is the censorship infrastructure centralised or widespread? Do you have means to implement specific censorship orders only in selected regions?
* Is there a single team in a single place responsible for implementing censorship or could order be passed on to different teams and could this result in multiple censorship techniques being implemented concurrently?
* Is there a dashboard allowing you to know, at any given time, everything that is censored and the mechanism or mechanisms with which it’s censored?
* Do you monitor user traffic to determine whether, by any means, users are able to circumvent the blocking that you have implemented?

**Accountability to the public**

* Are you transparent to users or the general public about what you are blocking?
* Do you display blocking notices to users when content they are trying to access is blocked?
* Do customers complain about certain things being blocked? Is there a process to be accountable to the customers about what websites and services are blocked?
* Do people ask why something is blocked? Do you have a process to deal with that?
* How do you communicate to users when the blocking happens upstream?
